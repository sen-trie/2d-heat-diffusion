# Description
This project models the temperature distribution of a thin rectangular plate made of a thermally conductive material using finite differences. The objective is to obtain temperature distributions over time using the heat equation in 2D, with the assumption that there is no internal heat generation. The boundary conditions can be either Dirichlet (fixed temperatures) or Neumann (fixed heat flux).

# Results
The simulation covers several test cases, including:
- Plates with uniform boundary temperatures
- Plates with varying edge temperatures
- Non-square rectangular plates
- Plates with localized fixed temperature patches

# Usage
Matlab code (**heatDiff.mlx**) is provided along with a report (**heatDiffReport.mlx**) explaining the computational method used to solve the equation. Adjust the parameters as needed to explore different scenarios and observe the heat diffusion process in real-time.
